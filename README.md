## readme

**msL96exprCDA.py**  is the main program for conducting the data assimilation experiment. It uses Python 3.x  to run multiscale Lorenz model and the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) for data assimilation. Scripts for conducting the experiments and diagnostic and plotting are all included in this file.

Essentially, we use observation system simulation experiment, which means the data are generated by the program. However, we have uploaded the data used for the experiment in the paper, in case the truth values might be different on different machines due to randomness.  See ./DATA
